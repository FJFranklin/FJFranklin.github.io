<p>Yet another blog, this one a place to collect thoughts about the various projects I work on. Mostly these revolve around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote control of semi-autonomous vehicles</li>
<li>Communication between devices</li>
<li>Metaheuristic optimisation</li>
<li>Structural analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll have more to say once I've learned how to blog properly on here.</p>
