  <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;">Model of a hook to be cut from 8mm-thick sheet steel.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the student exercises I have helped with in the past is to design a hook capable of supporting a 30kN load without yielding.
  The main limitation is that the hook should be cut from 8mm-thick high-strength steel, and the laser cutter can only handle straight lines and circular arcs.
  Sharp corners and tight radii should also be avoided, since these cause the laser cutter to pause briefly, and the additional heat can damage the material
  unnecessarily. In summary, the outline of the hook should be a single continuous path with tangent transitions - and without using ellipses or splines.</p>

<p>Professional CAD packages are very capable of solving the geometric constraints that designers impose. Generally it is also possible to
  parameterise key dimensions so that multiple similar designs can be analysed in sequence. Major packages such as ANSYS can even perform optimisation,
  searching for the specific set of parameters - and the corresponding design - that minimises the stress, or the mass, or some other selected property.</p>

<p>CAD packages tend to work interactively, but there are times when it is useful to be able to construct 3D models from code. Lately I have been exploring
  ANSYS SpaceClaim's scripting capability. This uses <a href="https://ironpython.net/documentation/dotnet/dotnet.html">IronPython</a>, a version of Python
  that integrates with Microsoft's .NET framework. Very minimal documentation is provided along with the ANSYS SpaceClaim installation, but the SpaceClaim
  interface includes some basic examples, and lets you record the interactive session as a script (although this is often a little muddled). There are also
  a few useful videos on YouTube, e.g.:
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av_1Jo1IjkI">How to use scripting features in ANSYS SpaceClaim to run your CAD design iterations</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQFMuUtpRlo">SpaceClaim for Parametric Analysis</a>.</p>

<p>I'm gradually learning SpaceClaim scripting. My original goal was to be able to parameterise a 3D NURBS surface representing a ship's hull. Eventually this
  had so many parameters that it was simpler to read them from a file. More recently, I discovered that ANSYS Static Structural will mesh a SpaceClaim helical
  design far better than it will an identical solid produced in Autodesk Inventor, but parametric sketches are (in my opinion) a lot easier to construct in the
  latter. Being able to sketch the profile in SpaceClaim using Python leads to a simple and versatile 3D model.</p>

<p>The need for a simple sketching engine capable of stitching together lines and circular arcs (with smooth circular-arc transitions) has led to
  <a href="https://github.com/FJFranklin/wifi-py-rpi-car-controller/tree/master/sketch">sketch</a>, designed to work with either SpaceClaim or MatPlotLib. The latter
  shows the construction circles and centres:</p>

  <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;">Left: Straight lines intersecting with optional transition radius. Right: Curved transitions between arcs.</p>
</div>

  <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;">Various curved transitions between straight lines and circular arcs.</p>
</div>

The same, sketched in SpaceClaim, with automatic detection of closed loops to form surfaces, can be seen here:

</ul>

<p>This is not, of course, intended as a replacement for SpaceClaim, which is far more powerful when used interactively. It's just a way to use SpaceClaim to build simple
  parameteric models. It's one thing to
  <a href="https://github.com//FJFranklin/wifi-py-rpi-car-controller/raw/master/sketch/images/arc-test-2-hook.png">sketch the outline of a hook</a>,
  quite something else to have a 3D geometry ready for FEA analysis in ANSYS:</p>

  <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;">Extruded hook with <em>Named Selections</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>It's still very much a work-in-progress, and hopefully will not be completely broken when I update from API v16 to v17...</p>
