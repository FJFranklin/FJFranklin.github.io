  <p style="font-style:italic;font-size:smaller;">Helical conduit, colored in.</p>
</div>

<p>As a brief addendum to my last post: It is now possible to create helical revolutions using
  <a href="https://github.com/FJFranklin/wifi-py-rpi-car-controller/tree/master/sketch">sketch</a> within SpaceClaim. As with extrusions, the different faces can be
  reliably identified and turned into <i>Named Selections</i> - or, as in the example shown (an interlocking conduit), the faces can be colored individually, which
  I think makes the geometry a little easier to interpret. (Although, perhaps the purple-blue scale isn't the best.)</p>

<p>The next step is to find a way to split or segment the helix so that sections can be targetted for analysis later on in ANSYS Static Structural. A helix is
  basically just a spring, but the interlocking makes things interesting...</p>
